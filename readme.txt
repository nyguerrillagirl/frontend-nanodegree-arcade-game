Frogger Clone - Get Mindy to the Water!

You play the role of Mindy, the damsal with not much to do today other than to see how many
time she can get to the water as she dodges bugs that seem to get faster and faster the more 
times she crosses over to the water

How to Play

What happens when Mindy reaches the water?

Mindy moves to the next level where the bugs get slightly faster.

Game Design notes:
1. Added Game Pause feature.

	When the players moves off the browser tab window the game pauses and resumes when focus returns.

2. Added a new JavaScript file utility.js. The file has one main object Frogger that captures this
	game specifics. 

3. The game provides the user with 3 lives. 

4. The game tracks each time the player reaches the water and increases the game up a level 
	which makes the bugs slightly faster.

5. Added sound effects for when the player reaches the water or collides with a bug.
